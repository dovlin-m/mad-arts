      'For me, I think, as for most artists, drawing is not just a profession, it is my way of living and expressing myself. I\'ve been painting all my life. I am a designer teacher by education, and I also have an art education. Thanks to this, I can vary in different styles when I paint. I also often apply my knowledge of art history in my works.',
      'I continue to study and improve my skills now, because there is no limit to perfection in this craft.',
      'I like to immerse myself in various projects, create new worlds and universes together with other people. I easily find a common language with people and am always open to new opportunities and cooperation.',
      'My main goal is to create a product that will inspire not only me, but also you. I am sure that with your help we can achieve a lot together. I will be glad to have the opportunity to work with you and create something amazing!',
