  life: [
    'This project was done while I was in college, I explored the human experience through the creation of the Ego art object and an accompanying exhibition called Life. The task was to come up with and draw several art objects that reflect the theme of the exhibition and create one of the art objects.',
    'After careful consideration of various concepts, I settled on the idea of portraying the human ego. Bust in aggressive red, life size, decorated with a metal crown resembling a wreath of thorns. This symbolic crown represented a self-imposed burden that we put on ourselves, causing visible cracks to spread across the protagonist\'s head and face, signifying their own doom. The weight of the crown pressed down, locking in their inner world.',
    'However, the removal of this crown made it possible to look into the depths of the protagonist\'s mind, revealing a cosmic landscape that personifies inner peace and love. This image symbolized the potential for personal growth and transformation. In this cosmic space, a single flower has blossomed, serving as a metaphor for the flowering of the inner self.',
    'Through the Life exhibition, I sought to encourage viewers to introspect and confront the complexities of their own existence. By shedding the weight that binds us, we can discover our inner beauty and serenity, embarking on a path of self-discovery and personal growth. The objects in this exhibition showed different emotions, feelings and stages in our lives. The task was to do something that is familiar to everyone, like birth, death, love, stupidity or ego.',

  academic_head: [
    'Here, you will find a collection of my academic drawings, featuring plaster heads of Diadumen and Verera.',
    'My artistic journey began with the study of still lifes and simple shapes, understanding their forms and dimensions. As I progressed, I delved into the complexities of drawing human heads. I find great joy in breaking them down into individual planes, exploring their intricacies and how they fit together to create a complete form. Some of my drawings are rough and sketchy, as I explore and experiment with capturing the planes within each head.',
    'In addition to the rough drawings, you will also find softer works where accuracy and precision take precedence. These pieces emphasize the fine details and strive for a greater level of realism. Additionally, there are a couple of still lifes featuring heads, where I explore how the human form interacts with its environment. For example, if there is a flower in the foreground, I aim to depict it with a harder, more scratchy texture to create contrast.',
    'As I reflect on these works, I recognize that they may contain mistakes. However, I find them charming, sweet, and imbued with a sense of naivety. I have chosen to include them in this portfolio as a testament to my artistic progress. They serve as a reminder of where I started and allow viewers to witness my growth and development over time.',

Inspired by my passion and rich cultural heritage, my thesis project plunges into the mystical realm of Baba Yaga, goblin, swamp and domestic Kikimora, Samodiva, the cult hut on chicken legs and other characters. Thanks to extensive research and Slavic legends, I carefully described and sketched these charming characters.',
    'The idea behind the book is to present it as a little girl\'s diary, fearlessly documenting encounters with these unseen creatures through the lens of a child\'s wonder. The narrative does not distinguish between good and evil beings, but rather embraces the desire to befriend all of them. This project also aims to popularize Slavic legends among children and adults, allowing everyone to go on a magical adventure filled with folklore and imagination.',

Exploring different types of fonts allowed me to appreciate their unique characteristics and understand how they can evoke different moods and emotions.',
    'To deepen my understanding, I not only studied type on paper but also created detailed diagrams to analyze and compare different fonts.
