Bust in aggressive red, life size, decorated with a metal crown resembling a wreath of thorns. This symbolic crown represented a self-imposed burden that we put on ourselves, causing visible cracks to spread across the protagonist's head and face, signifying their own doom. The weight of the crown pressed down, locking in their inner world.","However, the removal of this crown made it possible to look into the depths of the protagonist's mind, revealing a cosmic landscape that personifies inner peace and love. This image symbolized the potential for personal growth and transformation. In this cosmic space, a single flower has blossomed, serving as a metaphor for the flowering of the inner self.","Through the Life exhibition, I sought to encourage viewers to introspect and confront the complexities of their own existence. By shedding the weight that binds us, we can discover our inner beauty and serenity, embarking on a path of self-discovery and personal growth.
